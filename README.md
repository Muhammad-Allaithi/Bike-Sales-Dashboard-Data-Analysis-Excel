## Process

- Visualized average income per gender and their likelihood of purchasing a bike, using bar charts.
- Line chart showcasing bike purchases across different age brackets (adolescent, middle age, and old).
- Analysis of how commute distances (0-1 miles, 1-2 miles, etc.) impact the likelihood of purchasing a bike, displayed through a line chart.
- Utilized slicers for marital status, education, region, and commute distance, allowing dynamic data exploration and comparisons.

## Project Insights

- Income and Bike Purchases.
- Age Groups and Bike Purchases.
- Commute Distance and Bike Purchases.
- Impact of Filters.

## Final Conclusion

The "Bike Sales Dashboard" shows that higher-income individuals, especially males, are more likely to purchase bikes. Middle-aged customers make up the majority of buyers, while adolescents and older groups purchase less. Customers with shorter commutes are more likely to buy bikes, with purchases decreasing as commute distance increases. Filters for education, marital status, and region offer further analysis opportunities.
