## Questions
- How does income vary between customers who purchased bikes and those who didn't?
- How does age affect the likelihood of bike purchases?
- How does the distance customers commute relate to bike purchases?
- Do factors such as marital status, education, and region influence bike purchases?

## Process
- Visualized average income per gender and their likelihood of purchasing a bike, using bar charts.
- Line chart showcasing bike purchases across different age brackets (adolescent, middle age, and old).
- Analysis of how commute distances (0-1 miles, 1-2 miles, etc.) impact the likelihood of purchasing a bike, displayed through a line chart.
- Utilized slicers for marital status, education, region, and commute distance, allowing dynamic data exploration and comparisons.
